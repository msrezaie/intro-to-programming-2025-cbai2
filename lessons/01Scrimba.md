### Scrimba

The interface probably will look a little different than other video-based learning tools (e.g. Treehouse, Udemy, Khan Academy, etc.). Once logged in you can access the course library from the **Courses** link in the menu.

The Scrimba Courses Library page will show all courses and you can filter by Topic and choose the course you want to look at. Each week, there will be links to specific course lesson material that will cover the topics for that week.

### Scrimba Lesson Interface

In order to see a particular course’s lesson content you have to first “enroll” in the course. This involves clicking a start button.

Afterward, a course menu will allow you to navigate to each lesson

## You can _either_ use the written Odin Project lessons _or_ the video lessons in Scrimba. You can do both if you have them time and want to, but using just one or the other will teach what is needed to complete the coding assignments.
For the Odin Project, Go to each link in this list and read through the content on that page. If there are links you are redirected to as you read/work through the content, follow those links as well and read the content there too.
